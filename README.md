# flaskplay

Web software for controlling my personal Helldivers II based cosplay. Backend is handled by Python, front-end is handled with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

# Server

This is where all the web development lives, consisting of mostly Python for the backend and the entire front-end being hand-rolled HTML and CSS with sprinkles of JS as needed.

# "Diver"

Also known as the bulk of the program. This manages basically everything that *isn't* the web server.
